                Learn about the history of virtual reality and how it works.
                
                Have you ever wondered what it was like to be a firefighter? How about an airplane pilot? Maybe you would like to know what it is like to work as a chef in a restaurant kitchen. One way to find out would be to visit that workplace and shadow someone who does that job for a day. Sadly, this may not be possible. The job of a firefighter is often dangerous. You may not know a pilot or or a chef that you could ask.
                
                An easier, more convenient, and safer way to find out would be to step into a virtual world where you could see the workplace of your choice. Another word for this sort of virtual world is virtual reality (VR). Virtual worlds may sound like science fiction, but they are something you can experience right now. Maybe even at home!...
                
                
                
                A Brief History of VR:
                
                One of the first VR systems was the Sensorama. It came out in the early
                1960s. The Sensorama was a personal, immersive theatre. When a user put their head into the device, they experienced wind, sound, and even smells that were associated with the video they were watching! The stereoscopic system used lenses and two sets of film to create the feeling of depth.
                
                VR continued to develop through the 1960s. Some highlights from this time include the first VR-based flight simulator. It also included the creation of the first VR headset. The headset, developed by Harvard professor Ivan Sutherland, allowed the wearer to explore a simple virtual room.

                Advantages of Using VR:
                There are a number of advantages to using
                VR systems instead of doing the same activities in real life.
                People can explore careers using VR. As mentioned in the introduction, users can explore the daily life of a person in a career they’re curious about.
                People can also be trained to do tasks in a
                virtual environment. This is especially useful when training for surgery. In the VR world, you
                can try things over and over until you get it right. In real surgery, you only get one chance to do it right!

                Disadvantages of Using VR:
                Did you know?
                
                
                VR is pretty amazing, but it does have a few disadvantages. First is the cost factor. While VR sets have come down in price, they are still relatively expensive. Depending on the make and model, home VR sets can range from several hundred dollars to more than $1000. Specialized equipment, like that used in running surgical simulations, can cost much more.
                
                Not only is the equipment expensive, BUT VR videos are ALSO expensive to make. Customized video for specific training tasks can cost over $150 000.
